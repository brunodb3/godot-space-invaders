# [WIP] [GDLearn #3] Space Invaders Clone

This is the third entry on my personal challenge, the **GDLearn**. My goal is to upload at least one game to itch.io every month, on an attempt to learn about video game development using the Godot Engine.

Space Invaders clone is a simple 2D game where the player controls a ship and shoots at waves of incoming aliens.

Be aware this is a prototype made for learning purposes only.

## Controls

- Work in progress, controls not yet defined

Enjoy!
